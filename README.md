Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:

Functional Requirements:


A login option should be made available for all the new users of the LIS.
A verification mail should be sent when the user logs in for the first time through different systems.
If there is failure to enter the correct password for some attempts the account should be paused.
Some features like issuing or returning a book should be made available to members of LIS only.
If the book is already borrowed by any other user, then the system should not give an option of borrowing to the user and tell the user that the book is borrowed by others.
Search options should be made available for searching different types of books based on their names, author name ,type of book .
Records of books should be maintained according to their types. Example: philosophy,comics,science,math,novels,etc.
New arrivals in the library should be there on the top of the web-page.
The librarian should have the control to insert new books when purchased and remove the books which are already cleared from the shelf.
Borrowing waiting list should be there in order to check the demand of the book, so that some users who wanted to extend their borrowing date can do so if no other booking for that book is there.
For  a particular user, the system should display a list of the currently borrowed books, books borrowed in the past, date of borrowing and returning books if the user wants the details of the past history
Non-members can access this web application free to browse/search online.
System should notify the user and librarian of the overdue books and calculate the fine for the overdue books when they are returned.



Non-Functional Requirements:



Security- Only 3 attempts are allowed for a password else an email is sent to the user email id within 10 seconds for account verification.The system would ask an user a username and password for entering into the system. It should also make sure that the it works on the institute LAN.
Performance - The system should respond to requests within two to three seconds, to ensure good performance of the system.
Portability -  It is possible to access the database in any system other than the system in which it is created, but only a system verification is there before it.
Reliability - System should be available in the duration when the library operates. There should not occur any failure in the system during this particular time.
Scalability - System should not give an error and work reliably when there are more users accessing the system.
Accuracy - The system should ensure that the data stored about the books, the fines calculated should be correct and consistent.
Flexibility - In case the system is required to be updated by new features, it should work properly.
Usability - System should make sure that the user can get relevant information with ease. The UI should be simple enough to understand by everyone. It can be made even easier if there is an option for choosing different languages.

Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.


Scope:

The scope of this application is wide as it is working in real time using the artificial intelligence of detecting common sounds which is very much useful for people suffering from hearing loss.


Features:

Some of the features like vibrations or flash light should be there when some type of sound is sensed.
The user can set different types of vibration strength for different types of sound they want.
Sounds like vehicle horns, doorbells,babies , and even many such sounds.
Even flash light should be used just the way as vibration to create an alert signal.
This kind of application should be made connected to wearable devices as such devices are  in direct contact to the person.
A security login and logout should be made available (fingerprint or passcode)that only the user can turn off the alerts .

Non-Functional aspects:

The response should be as quick as possible so that the user gets the alert instantly.
It should be accurate and errorless so that the user can make his next move accordingly.
In case of system failure the user should be notified prior to it.
addition of new voices should be available.
The system should be updated from time to time to ensure giving more features to the users.
The system should be easy to understand and should have features easy to use.
